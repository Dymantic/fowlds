        <p class="mb-8">
        From a very young age, I lived and played in the African bush, enjoying the natural wonders provided by nature. My passion for nature in later life has forged a career in preserving wildlife, teaching our youth in the abundant wealth of nature and conserving a vanishing way of Life.

        For over a decade I have been involved in a private park restoration in Southern Africa and recently started consulting in West Africa. My knowledge and passion has been conveyed to thousands of youth in schools through community conservation awareness. This work created a much needed fund raising drive for an NGO with the aid of the corporate social investment portfolios which spells out the slogan “Stop Wildlife Crime”.
