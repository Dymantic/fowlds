    <p class="max-w-lg mx-auto">Along with my friend and well-known author Graham Spence I have had the privilege of being able to tell my stories of the work I do and reveal the struggles we face in wildlife conservation. I thank all the people I have worked with that are tirelessly on the frontlines of conservation, as well as those who have made these book publications possible.</p>
