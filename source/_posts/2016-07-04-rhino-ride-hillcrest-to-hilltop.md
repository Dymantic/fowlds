<p>ARE you willing to ride more than 100 kilometres to raise awareness for<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://zululandobserver.co.za/site-search/?q=Project%20Rhino" target="_blank">Project Rhino</a></span>?</p>
<p>After last year&rsquo;s inaugural Ride for Rhino turned out a success, the event is now an annual one.</p>
<p>The main route will span 350kms, from Hillcrest to Hilltop Camp in Hluhluwe Game Reserve.</p>
<p>Alternate distances of 240kms and 100kms will start from Darnall and Empangeni respectively.</p>
<p>Featuring a gruelling last 35kms from the Centenary centre in iMfolozi Game Reserve, the very park in which the rhino were once saved from extinction in 1961, the cycle is arguably the toughest 1-day mountain bike ride in South Africa.</p>
<p>The first riders will begin at 1am on Saturday, December 12.</p>
<p>Organisers aim to time the other two groups to arrive and ride through the reserve entrance together with the main group.</p>
<p>For safety, the ride has a cut off time of 17 hours, as predators in the Hluhluwe and iMfolizi reserves may pose a threat to the riders after dark.</p>
<p>The ride is a self-funded one; no entry fees will be charged, and each participant will cover their own expenses.</p>
<p>However, donations are welcomed, to further Project Rhino&rsquo;s awareness campaign.</p>
