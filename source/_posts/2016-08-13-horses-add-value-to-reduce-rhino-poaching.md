<p>Project Thorn is a revival of horse patrols in the remote Wilderness Areas of Imfolizi Game Reserve in KwaZulu Natal. The acronym stands for ''Tangible Help our Rhino Needs-THORN''. The revival was initiated by Karrie hovey and Charles Merrill of California USA in April 2015 while doing a Rhino Art road show in Mtubatuba with Project Rhino Team members.</p>

<p>Since legendry rangers like the late Ian Player and Nick Steele saved the Rhino from extinction - horses played a major role in the Conservation of the Flagship park of KwaZulu Natal-the Hhluhluwe Imfolozi&nbsp;National park. In 2009 various factors lead to thier demise and the stables were left empty.</p>

<p>Ranger Ken Tinley and his colleague in Imfolizi several decades Ago. The White rhino was saved by a few brave men under Operation Rhino by protection and moving several animals to other Parks to start a breeding nucleus.</p>

<p>These are the tough variety of horses that remain in the Nqumeni Section of the park which are still operational and effective for patrols.</p>

<p>A final base Camp will be&nbsp;stationed to the South of the Wilderness at Makhamisa. This facility will house 4 horses and has the best facilities available. A second groom will be stationed here with the equine team.&nbsp;There is also a&nbsp;tracker Dog unit&nbsp;positioned with a kennel and handler.&nbsp;This well appointed Stone design has a Coral to train horses. The predator proof boundary around the facility is in good order.</p>
