<p><u>Rhino Art- Let Our Voices Be Heard is a Global Youth Movement</u></p>
<p>Objective: In an effort to fight the war against poaching, Rhino Art involves local communities that are at times the silent witnesses to the slaughter and all forms of Wildlife Crime. We increase conservation awareness amongst the youth and cultivate a next generation of wildlife 'ambassadors' that has a vested interest in the protection of rhino and other endangered species. Rhino Art - 'Let the children's voices be heard' project's aim is to gather the largest number of children's 'Art Voices' ever recorded in support of Rhino Protection, and to use these 'Hearts and Minds' messages from the children of Africa, as a worldwide call to action against poaching.</p>

<p>Situated in Robertson- Van Loveren provide a popular brand of Wine and create employment to hundreds of people in the Western Cape.</p>
<p>The Van Loveren vineyards have been in a family since 1937 when Hennie Retief Sr. bought some land in the Robertson area. This property was later sub-divided and Hennie started farming on Goudmyn portion "F". His wife, Jean (her maiden name was Van Zyl), disliked the farm's designation and said it stood, to her mind, for &ldquo;fools and failures&rdquo;. As a result she persuaded her husband to rename the farm. At first they contemplated calling it Roche Rouge, after the impressive red ridge of the Elandsberg Mountain that formed a backdrop to their home.</p>
<p>Jean, a traditionalist, however convinced Hennie to name the farm after Christina van Loveren &ndash; an ancestor whose bridal chest was passed down for generations and remains on the farm to this day. Christina was married to the first Van Zyl to arrive in South Africa in 1699.From the mid 1990's Nico and Wynand's four sons joined the farm one after the other as they completed their studies. Today our <strong>Four cousins</strong> are the driving force behind the company. Hennie and Neil are viticulturists, Bussell is the winemaker and Phillip looks after the business side of things..</p>
<p>Van Loveren is South Africa's biggest family-owned winery.<img src="/assets/media/32/conversions/web.jpg" /></p>

Released in 1,5l bottles, it hit the market with a bang and is today South Africa&rsquo;s biggest selling bottled brand.</p>

<p><em>Quote from Robertson</em>:</p>
<p><em> It was especially meaningful to see both the concern, and the joy, that it brought to the children's faces - making the message meaningful, but fun, seems to be a key balance to the delivery.</em></p>
