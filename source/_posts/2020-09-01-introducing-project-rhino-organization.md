Project Rhino is collectively responsible for the protection of the second largest rhino population on the continent and the most genetically diverse white rhino population. Devastatingly, our rhino have become a target for highly organised poaching rings and crime syndicates, fuelled largely by an ongoing and unfounded demand by traditional Eastern medicine. Rhino numbers have plummeted – almost 9,000 have been lost in RSA in the last decade – whilst the costs of keeping the remaining populations safe have increased astronomically.

<h3 class="h2">What Project Rhino Does</h3>

<p class="h3 mb-0">Co-ordination Unit:</p>
The team that keeps the engines running, co-ordinating stakeholders, prioritising needs, sourcing funds, and keeping the ship afloat and moving in the right direction. This is the glue that binds the various players, without which we would see an uncoordinated, disjointed and dysfunctional response to the pressing issues of Wildlife Crime.

<p class="h3 mb-0">Ranger and Technical Support:</p>
Direct training equipment support to rangers, equipping supporting the K9 and Equine units, and the ZAP-Wing aerial surveillance unit, including the lease and support costs of the airfield at Hluhluwe, Zululand.

<p class="h3 mb-0">Education and Engagement:</p>
Interaction with youth and communities, through Rhino (Wild) Art, Youth camps, Leadership forums, World Youth Wildlife Summit and others.

<p class="h3 mb-0">Wildlife Economy and Enterprise:</p>
Supporting and building a network of responsible use landscapes, and identifying enterprises that can benefit all stakeholders, including equitable and ethical transactions with all stakeholders.

<p class="h3 mb-0">Ambassador</p>
Grant Fowlds is a South African conservationist with a unique commitment to everything endangered. His vision is to try to fill the shoes of the many conservationists and his recent undercover filming of a tusk and horn auction in Vietnam demonstrates that he is not afraid of confrontation.

He is a passionate Conservationist from a dedicated Rhino Family, who pioneered with others a wildlife project called Amakhala Game Reserve – now a leading Tourism brand based in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. As an ambassador for Project Rhino and speaker, he has spread the word to an audience in several countries including consumer countries of South East Asia.

As an African linguist, Grant shares the vision of African Explorer Kingsley Holgate to reach one million youth in community conservation for rhino, elephants and gorillas as well as other endangered species in a simple art project in schools. He has been working in rural communities throughout Southern Africa in human wildlife conflict, demand reduction and alternate sources of income via tourism and building range expansion parks.

'Exceptionally readable - a fluid and captivating story . . . a swashbuckling tale.' – _Dr Dave Cooper, Rhinos Without Borders veterinarian, and Debbie Cooper of iSimang_
