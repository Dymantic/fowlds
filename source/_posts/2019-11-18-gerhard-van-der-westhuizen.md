I was born and raised in the Western Cape, where my family still resides. I have been a Level 2 Field Guide for almost 10 years, and a full trails guide for almost 5 years. My passion is wildlife - from handling snakes and walking amongst the big 5, to learning new plants and the different constellations. My other hobbies include learning about bonsais and new techniques for photography. I have been fortunate enough in my career to be able to develop my photography skills by meeting others with the same passion, and with the many perfect shot opportunities on my safaris.

I am currently the Head Guide on a reserve in KZN where I live with my wife Samantha. We hope to start a family in the near future, and I look forward to raising my children in the bushlife.

I hope to develop my photography in the coming years, and share the joy I have for wildlife through my images. I can’t go into too much detail about where the photo (on the Grant’s book cover) was taken, but I can say it was a dry region of the Western Cape.
