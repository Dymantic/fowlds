I was born and raised in the Western Cape, where my family still resides. I have been a Level 2 Field Guide for almost 10 years, and a full trails guide for almost 5 years. My passion is wildlife - from handling snakes and walking amongst the big 5, to learning new plants and the different constellations. My other hobbies include learning about bonsais and new techniques for photography. I have been fortunate enough in my career to be able to develop my photography skills by meeting others with the same passion, and with the many perfect shot opportunities on my safaris.

I am currently the Head Guide on a reserve in KZN where I live with my wife Samantha. We hope to start a family in the near future, and I look forward to raising my children in the bushlife.

I hope to develop my photography in the coming years, and share the joy I have for wildlife through my images.

The photo on Grantâ€™s book cover was taken during my game drive. I came across two rhinos mating. Just as I got my camera ready, the female ran away from the male and headed towards the vehicle. I managed to capture this image just before she turned away, with the male following after her.
