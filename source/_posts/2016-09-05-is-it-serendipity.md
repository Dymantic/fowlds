<p>A few weeks ago I worked on an excerpt from&nbsp;<a href="http://wildpolitics.us12.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=7b62dcf05adf012bf035416d6&amp;id=495b9d08ea&amp;e=fef2433b8a" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://wildpolitics.us12.list-manage1.com/track/click?u%3D7b62dcf05adf012bf035416d6%26id%3D495b9d08ea%26e%3Dfef2433b8a&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473144829434000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHT6QRzy1F5y4B46tQOhZg-M6QLbw">Birdsong After the Storm</a>&nbsp;and developed it into an article for&nbsp;<a href="http://wildpolitics.us12.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=7b62dcf05adf012bf035416d6&amp;id=2e9786739f&amp;e=fef2433b8a" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://wildpolitics.us12.list-manage1.com/track/click?u%3D7b62dcf05adf012bf035416d6%26id%3D2e9786739f%26e%3Dfef2433b8a&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473144829434000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEZrbIubC5txfUf-8uw-r9kCGfDZA">openDemocracy</a>. The theme is familiar to many of you. I was making the case that many of the big NGOs in North America and Europe have lost their connection with why they started their conservation work. They have morphed into a form of market environmentalism with unintended consequences for local communities in Africa, Asia and South America.<br /><br />I used some case studies to illustrate my point.

My article became part of the momentum.<br /><br />In the past few days I have wondered if it was serendipity or if something else is afoot. I have been surprised how readily conservationists have embraced the ideas I propose.<br /><br />Perhaps many of us sense the current system has major flaws. Perhaps we are yearning to hear about solutions that are &lsquo;human scale&rsquo; &ndash; proposals local enough and small enough that we can embrace and understand them. Perhaps we want solutions that don&rsquo;t require begging big business to come to the rescue or for the super-rich to feel benevolent.<br /><br />Somewhere inside we know the world is already full of people, and that setting aside great wilderness area means moving many of them. We worry.&nbsp; Will it work? Where will they go? What happen when the world population grows?<br /><br />I believe that big NGOs need to devolve their grip on how conservation is conceived and respond to community ideas and wisdom about protecting the wildlife with which they live.<br /><br />In July&nbsp;<a href="http://wildpolitics.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7b62dcf05adf012bf035416d6&amp;id=67ab37133b&amp;e=fef2433b8a" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://wildpolitics.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u%3D7b62dcf05adf012bf035416d6%26id%3D67ab37133b%26e%3Dfef2433b8a&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473144829434000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG65e2nA29qHQxrd34gn2wz1VN7XQ">Victoria Tauli-Corpuz</a>, UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, tabled a damning report to the UN General Assembly. She sounded the alarm about the impact that conservation is having on tribal peoples in Kenya, Uganda, Bangladesh, Namibia, Botswana, Ethiopia, South Africa, Argentina, Chile and Ecuador. I extend this alarm to many local communities in rural landscapes around the world. Victoria Tauli-Corpuz rightly asserts that many of the better conserved forests, savannahs and waters are in indigenous peoples&rsquo; territories.<br /><br />Big conservation NGOs need to free themselves from corporate pressures and transform themselves into supporters of local civil society. There is an important role for them to play &ndash; they can project the unpasteurised voices of local communities into the halls of the United Nations.<br /><br />Together everyone is stronger. Together we can turn our collective might on what is really destroying the world and the wildlife we cherish.<br /><br />Perhaps it is not serendipity that these articles were all published at the same time. Perhaps we are getting ready to shift the paradigm.&nbsp;</p>
