<div class="blogPostBody">He is a hero in our minds.<br /> He travels the world educating people about rhino poaching.<br /> He's involved in saving the rhino and saving the land for future generations.<br /> And, in the middle of his mission, he found the time to join us at the Lodge, his home...<br /> and spoil us with his time <br /> and a private game drive<br /> and cocktails at sunset on a bluff overlooking the three lionesses under a tree, <br /> six rhinos in the distance <br /> and a herd of mixed buck to the east.<br /> Never wanted to leave.<br /> Loved his stories, <br /> his passion<br /> and the peace of the land as the sun settled over the distant mountains.<br /> Thank you Grant Fowlds...<br /> you are a true hero.</div>
