<p>Give your time. Give your money. Give encouragement. Give love. Give abundantly.</p>
<p>I have met many people in my last few years in business. I have been to hundreds of networking events. Done hundreds of schools w talks to plenty of people. Started a few companies. Failed many times. Succeeded in a few. I have never seen so many people who lack the concept of generosity as I see in today&rsquo;s business world, however, I see this changing.</p>
<p>Too may people will just shove their business cards in others faces, add strangers on Facebook and then immediately pitch their businesses, and just expect business to fall on their laps. This is not how successful people act nor is it a successful way to conduct business, if you want to sustain growth.<em><br /></em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Give what you have. To someone, it may be better than you dare to think.&rdquo; <em>&mdash; Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;A fight is going on inside me,&rdquo; said an old man to his son. &ldquo;It is a terrible fight between two wolves. One wolf is evil. He is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego. The other wolf is good. He is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion and faith. The same fight is going on inside&nbsp;you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The son thought about it for a minute and then asked, &ldquo;Which wolf will&nbsp;win?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man replied simply, &ldquo;The one you feed.&rdquo;<em> &mdash; Wendy Mass, Jeremy Fink and the Meaning of&nbsp;Life</em></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&ldquo;If you want to call attention to your good deed then it isn&rsquo;t a good deed, it&rsquo;s a self-serving one. Why? Not only have you patted yourself on the back but you&rsquo;re fishing for others to do the same.&rdquo; <em>&mdash; Donna Lynn&nbsp;Hope</em></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&ldquo;Being generous often consists of simply extending a hand. That&rsquo;s hard to do if you are grasping tightly to your righteousness, your belief system, your superiority, your assumptions about others, your definition of normal.&rdquo; &mdash;&nbsp;<em>Patti&nbsp;Digh<br /></em></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&ldquo;Generosity is giving more than you can, and pride is taking less than you need.&rdquo; <em>Khalil&nbsp;Gibran<br /></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">No matter what you do, where you live, what religion you are, what race, generosity is important. It is more than important, generosity is a <em>necessity</em>.<em><br /></em></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Remember when you are conducting business, when you are talking to others, that generosity is one of those &ldquo;ONE THING&rsquo;s&rdquo; that can radically change your business. Generosity is giving without expecting anything in return. If you can do things from a place of pure generosity, you will have never ending business. People do business with people they know, like, and trust.</p>
