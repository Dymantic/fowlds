My affection started with these large Mega-herbivores in 2003 when we translocated a herd from Phinda Game Reserve to start a new herd at Amakhala Game Reserve in the Eastern Cape. I was oblivious to the fact that these pachyderms, like Rhino would come in and out of my Conservation career over the next two decades.

It was a privilege to work with incredible Vets, and Conservationists during this time like Dr Dave Cooper, Kester Vickery, Dereck Milburn, Dr Andre Uys, Dr Heinz Kohrs, the late Chris Holcroft, Dr Lucy King and my own brother Dr Will Fowlds.

I fought hard for the removal of excess Elephants out Atherstone Nature reserve in Limpopo to new Range in the Eastern Cape. In KwaZulu natal I came across a herd of 24 Wild Elephants at Mawana Game Reserve later to cause the Founding of Loziba Wilderness. This lead me to several Conflict situations being diffused by trying to resolve Conflict around too many elephants in the Pongola Game Reserve. I love spending time with the Graceful, massive Tuskers remaining in Tembe Elephant park.

I admire the story of Addo Elephant park from 11 elephants to several hundreds. Our Vision to expand this land is one of our Rewilding Visions.

In 2015 we launched Elephant Art in Kinshasa as part of the Kingsley Holgate expedition to find the Geographical Centre of the African Continent. The lessons were in French at a Catholic School in Kinshasa.

The expedition was a tribute to the Forest elephants that have been persecuted in several African Countries in the Congo basin.

The Link is Long but on World Elephant Day August 2021 I was invited to Address the New York Explorers Club on my Experience with African Elephants

I now am involved in several Non Profits, Boards, Educational programmes and African countries to try and save these amazing mammals from all forms of persecution by Man.
