    <h3 class="h2 mb-8">Conservation.</h3>
    <p>Unbeknown to me, the real conservationist was born when I was a young boy growing up on the farm
that gave birth to Amakhala game reserve. A combination of declining agricultural margins forced my
hand into this sector through a tourism opportunity with a motto we adopted called ‘back to nature’.
Wildlife management started two decades ago and during this time the focus has been on sustainable
tourism – it has to pay to stay.</p>

    <h3 class="h2 mb-8">Consulting.</h3>
    <p>My love and passion for the wild and responsible tourism has resulted in an opportunity to consult in
tourism. This coupled with game introduction, reserve environmental planning has seen my career
take me to parts of west, southern and central africa. I have been a consultant in marketing
responsible tourism and an avid supporter of a green and sustainable model.</p>
